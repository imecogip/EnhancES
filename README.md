# EnhancES
## Download and Implementation of EnhancES into QGIS 
The EnhancES is stored as a ZIP-file (Figure 0.1).

The unpacking of the ZIP-file can be done by programs such as 7zip

or directly with onboard tools in Windows 10/11 shown here:

Each model package contains the model(s) itself (MODEL3) and already predefined values and/or important predefined datasets, which are mandatory for a successful usage (Figure 2.2). Layer style files (QML) are used to visualize the output results of models and can be adapted or replaced by user`s needs. EnhancES comes with free to use sample data for testing.

##2.3.	Usage of provided Start File
Currently, in development stage, EnhancES is not available as an on-demand plugin repository. By publishing the final stage of EnhancES it will be available as a plugin.
By now, the EnhancES models need to be integrated into QGIS to be used properly. To ease this process the toolbox comes with a start file, where all models and necessary data is already stored inside. For convenience, we promote using the available start file. Inside the start file you find EnhancES inside the Processing Toolbox pane (Figure 2.3).
